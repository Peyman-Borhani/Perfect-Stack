# Perfect-Stack
Stating the best development stack in 2020 onward for a new software / web development team. ðŸ› 

#### A guide to inform a new software development team about best tips, tools and information for Web Developers, Designers and Project Managers.  

## [Advice for new developers in 2020]

People use old/popular tech choices for some reason: as required by jobs, workplace old platforms, learned long ago, using different platforms/hard to update,... but if you're new to dev/web, need a refresh or doing a startup, pick the best tech useful to you at the time being.  
â–ª If your main goal is making mobile Apps for Android and IOS, then start with Flutter/dart, is the most cross-platform native SDK, covers all: mobile, web, desktop...  

â–ª For Web design and development follow this tips:
 1. Learn the base web standards-> (HTML, CSS, Javascript) follow/practice tutorials. Make few apps.(ex: Todo)
 2. New web standards -> ES6/next, new HTML, new CSS (grid,...)  practice/try what you learn.  
 3. Update the previous apps you made, using new things you learned. make a game and a blog site.
 4. Deploy: learn how to host/deploy your site. using either: Netlify, github/gitlab pages, zeit, surge...
 5. Learn a Frameworks: Svelte. current best rxperience. Light, simple, fast, code compiles to standard JS (not limited).  
 6. Learn other tools/libs/platforms afterwards, only if necessary, when needed.(ex: DB, AI, backend, cloud, tools...)  
 7. Learn Design: Patterns, tools, UI/UX(user interface/experience). Concepts: visual clarity, visual effects, utility 1st.  
 8. Responsive design: native looks, any device, clear focus, usability/accessibility. CSS flex, grid...
 9. Backend: either 1. Sapper(if using svelte) or 2. Deno: new js-runtime replacement for Node.js by its creator.  
 10. Summary: Be an expert on one or few fields, pro on few more, know the rest. Fullstack: Frontend+Backend ecosystem.  
 11. Personal Experience: Make a portfolio site (products show case). Make profile: CV, Linkedin, twitter.
 12. Final step: Work: Learn/do remote work/freelancing, or choose a skill relevant internship, get experience. Learn/Use collaboration platforms like GitHub/Lab. find a job or startup a new team.  Wish you the best.  
   

## [More Details]  
Framework Recommendations:  
â–ª Native development: Mobile,... â–ª Flutter / Dart, the most cross-platform native SDK, covers all: native Devices, web,...  
â–ª Frontend: 1.(Best) â–ª Svelte, best in total, great for new start or update migration strategy.  
â–ª Frontend: 2.(Minimal) â–ª Sinuous: fast minimal framework. â–ª Mikado: (Minimal/Max speed) in virtual-dom frameworks.  
â–ª Frontend: 3.(Job Offers): â–ª Vue, cool founder, developer/ecosystem. â–ª React/.net(Working at FB/MS company/platform)

â–ª Backend : 1. Deno, a runtime built by the creator of node.js, to be greater, secure default, lighter, faster, Wasm, latest tech.  
â–ª Backend : 2. Sapper if you are using svelte. ...... 3. Node.js: in case you want most features, support, compatiblity,...  
  
â–ª Svelte framework offers:  

1. Developer Experience: less coding concentrate on your goal/concept instead of development complexity.  
2. Standard: the code is compiled to standard JS. Fast/optimised, can be used anywhere, without FW dependencies.  
3. Less complexity: code is pre-compiled, no runtime framework issue/dependency, no online build process.  
3.1. Less Testing-Dependency issues: less unexpected reactions, glitches, slowdowns...happens at runtime.  
3.2. Less Testing/Errors: due to not having runtime dependancies on framework or external factors except your own code.  
4. Less Cost: more human understandable code, any employee can continue the work. + less bugs + less testing + faster development.  
  
  
âˆŽ Web Development what abouts...  
â–ª Front-end: Web app/site, Develop/Design of client side. HTML5.x, PWA, TWA, JavaScript, frameworks, Web assembly...  
â–ª Back-end: SSR(Server Side Rendering) development, Processing on server/distributed network. Admin, DevOps, tools, framework.  
â–ª Back-end frameworks: 1.Deno. 2.Spapper. 3.Node (KOA, Nest, Express).  
â–ª New web standards: ES6/next, new HTML, new CSS (Grid,Houdini,...), web components, Web Assembly.  
â–ª Svelte Framework: : performance+, DX+, compiles to JS (no FW runtime dependencies, less overhead).  
â–ª Developer Tools: Git Hub/Lab, other collaboration/open source platforms, Dev tools: CDT, CLI, npm...  
â–ª Correct development method â‡’ simple, secure, reusable, no overhead, less external dependencies.  

The web development eco-system was confusing in last 7 years with many tools, frame works, stacks, versions...due to different standards, browsers, platforms, new mobile devices,...  3rd party tools/libs..made to solve/patch these issues, or add features that didn't exist.
Good thing is the new web standards are available now, the most wanted features adopted in time, new HTML/ES/CSS features, solved issues, and add capabilities. matured frameworks... therefore old prefixes, 3rd party libs,... are not neccessary anymore, be up to date and follow the best practices.  

Todo:  Cloud platform, remote work, Data base, Web APIâ€™s, AI/ML / TensorFlow.
