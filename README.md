## [Honest Advice for new developers in 2020]
People use different tech choices as required by workplace, learned long ago or ...but if you're new to web, need a refresh or doing a startup, pick the best tech at the time being. follow these tips:  
 1. Learn well the base web standards -> (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and practice few tutorials, at least make one app.(ex: Todo)
 2. New web standards -> ES6/next, new HTML and CSS(grid, houdini),...  practice/try what you learn, 
 3. Update the previous app you made, with new standards. make a game and a site.
 4. Deploy: learn how to host/deploy your site. using either: Netlify, github/gitlab pages, zeit, surge...
 5. Frameworks: Svelte. currecntly is the best. Light, simple, fast, final work is compliled to standard JS. similar to no framework.
 6. Backend: Sapper(if using svelte) or Deno future js-runtime after Node.js by its creatorother tools or methods afterwards, if needed.  

The web development eco-system was confusing in last 7 years with many tools, frame works, stacks, versions...due to different standards/browsers, new mobile devices. Much 3rd party tools/libs..made to solve/patch these issues, or add features that didn't exist.  
Good thing is the new web standards are available now, the most wanted features adopted in time, new HTML/ES/CSS features, add capabilities without vendor prefixes or 3rd party libs.  
Backend: Deno, a Javascript runtime built by the creator of node.js, fix node's problems, secure by default, lighter and faster.  
Svelte framework offers ease of development, less coding, add extras, concentrate on your idea instead of development complexity...the code is compiled to standard JS. so can be used anywhere, fast and secure with less external dependencies.
