### [General Suggestions]

- Most developers use popular and usually outdated practices, due to: Job/workplace requirement, learned in the past, a senior's advice,...
considering they use and recommend same things for 20 years to others, if the cycle goes on for few times.
therefore what's most poplular might not be the best option at the time being.

- If you're a new developer, updating your skills or planning a startup, you're not bound to the above conditions, therefore do your own research, check few review comparisons, founders oppinion, and finally make decisions which benefit you in long-term.

#### Which Platforms?
- If you're only targeting mobile Apps for Android and IOS, then use Flutter/dart, it's a native cross-platform SDK, has very basic support for web and desktop... 
- But if you want a more general purpose open platform, use the web platform, and custom tech stack based on your requirements, such as "Capacitor" for mobile app development.

#### â–ª Learning tips
- Development is not simple, it takes time, effort, practice and experience to gain practical skill, as there are many things to cover.  
- 1st learn the basics including the new updates. Ex:  in web >> Basics and new additions of JS, HTML, CSS.  
- Learn from best tutorials/courses, search for recent materials from an experienced tutor with high views/stats, Ex: Fireship.io  
- Make a group, join friends, divide tasks/learning, share your findouts, work as a team,... is too much to handle by only one person.

 - **Programming Languages**:  Rust, Go, Nim, Dart, Swift... - (for specific use-case) - (server-side processing).  
  
### UI >>  
- Standard CSS is best... specially when used in modular/component form, such as in svelte.js     
- You might not need CSS libs, frameworks, pre-processors as new CSS standards solve problems developers had in the past.
- Yet there are use-cases, such as a standardized design system within a company:

  - **Minimal approachs**: â–ª ***(Structure)***: renderless, headless ui ....... â–ª ***(UI)***: milligram, chota, skeleton.

## **[Top Web Frameworks]**    

### Frontend: 
 - **1.(Best overall) â–ªSvelte**: best of all, DX, and integration with standards and all. long term strategic choice.  
 - **2.(Minimal)  â–ªSolid**: fast, efficient, stable, advanced features. .... â–ª**Marko**: solid with better DX. .... â–ª**Sinuous**: best minimal.
 - **3.(Job offers/forced/required)**:  **Vue** (popular). .... **Angular / React / .net** (GG/FB/MS company platforms)

### Backend :
**1. Deno**: a runtime built by the creator of node.js, it is great, secure by default, lighter, faster, Wasm, latest tech.  
**2. Sveltekit**: if you are using svelte.  **Snel**: Svelte project built and compiled on deno instead of node.  
**3. Node.js**: in case you want most available libs, support, compatibility.  Koa or polka are a good node.js framework.  
  
### Svelte framework offers:  
**1. Developer Experience**: less coding concentrate on your goal/concept instead of development complexity.  
**2. Standard**: the code is compiled to standard JS. Fast/optimized, can be used anywhere, reusable in future.  
**3. Less complexity**: code is pre-compiled, no runtime framework issue/dependency, no online build process.  
     - Less Testing-Dependency issues: less unexpected reactions, glitches, slowdowns...happens at runtime.  
     - Less Testing/Errors: due to not having runtime dependencies, or external factors except your own code.  
     
**4. Less Cost**: more human understandable code, more employees can continue the work. + less bugs + less testing + faster development.

## [The Web - status summary]  
The web eco-system was originally made to communicate with text or data, it later evolved to present simple graphics and images.
Afterwards hardware specs advanced, offering high performance and capacity, smartphones appeared, online use-cases and services.  
Therefore all these things affected the web status which became more complex and confusing in the last decade due to workarounds and fixes to support new features by vendor prefixes, 3rd party libs, tools and frameworks to achieve functional demands of dev/user/market. The slow adoption of new trends was caused by issues with backward compatibility of existing sites and old systems while native mobile and desktop platforms had all breaking changes required once a while. By the mean time all these 3rd party libraries, vendor prefixes and frameworks were made to solve/patch the issue and provide features that didn't exist in web standards yet.

Good news, the new web standards are available, evolved and solved issues and included the most wanted features, furthermore Frameworks evolved and new Web APIs provide functionality and access to new technologies. Therefore with much flexibility and compatibility Web can now compete with native desktop and mobile platforms.  

In summary use the main platform itself whenever you can!  some of the old prefixes, 3rd party libs,... are not required anymore...(as explained above) If you are new dev or refreshing your knowledge, be up to date and follow new trends and best practices of time being, not the past... unless required or there is no alternative. The recommended trends mentioned here were handpicked by checking reviews comparison, personal experiments, and what top professionals are using.

### New developer or decision maker? 

*"Details of Why you must not choose a tech only by popularity and statistics"*

- Avoid learning ~10+ years old stuff if a better alternative is available.
 old tech was made for past era ecosystem, development model and HW/SW/issues.  

- Is still popular due to seniors who learned it in past when it was a valid option and using it at work for years, later new developers are forced to follow them. This process might repeat multiple times...   

- The old popular tech nature: ___ it works, is popular and has big community and resources, yet in time it becomes more complex, due to extensions, compatibility patches and conflict solving layers to make both the original and new syntax/tools/requirements work together...  Aside of that each time a new feature is added, this process might repeat, and the platform gets large, complex, multiple different revisions.(Ex: MS SDKs, .net framework,...) 

- Breaking changes and migration: ___ when a new feature that contradicts something in the system which can't be solved, the devs will decide to either give up on the feature, add extra flags/configs or make a breaking change, thus you must stay on old branch or learn + update your previous codes or totally migrate if is hopeless.  

- Each time a breaking change shows up, you might need to repeat this process. this makes multiple dev branches in a company if the team can't / won't follow.  

- Issues: older and more different + higher level a platform be, these issues will stack-up, will cost time + resources + paid team to interface them.  

- Lower level coding is not much affected by the mentioned issues. they rarely change, and if so, is about efficiency and stability.  

- As old devs retire,  new ones might add new layers of abstraction instead of fixing the original code, these issues cause
 extra complexity, overhead, extra cost in long-term, Large number/size of files, large developer teams, or slow working pace,...
