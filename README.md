#### A guide to inform a new software development team about best tips, tools and information for Web Developers, Designers and Project Managers.  

[Honest Advice for new developer in 2020] people use different tech choices as required, or stuck with old ones,...but if you're new to web, or ready for an update, follow these tips: 1st learn well the base web standards (js,css,html) then New web standards, ES6/next, new HTML and CSS(grid, houdini),...for framework: svelte,  for backend: sapper(if using svelte) or Deno. other tools or methods afterwards, if needed.  

The web development eco-system was confusing in last 7 years with many tools, frame works, stacks, versions...due to different standards/browsers, new mobile devices. Much 3rd party tools/libs..made to solve/patch these issues, or add features that didn't exist.  
Good thing is the new web standards are available now, the most wanted features adopted in time, new HTML/ES/CSS features, add capabilities without vendor prefixes or 3rd party libs.  
Backend: Deno, a Javascript runtime built by the creator of node.js, fix node's problems, secure by default, lighter and faster.  
Svelte framework offers ease of development, less coding, add extras, concentrate on your idea instead of development complexity...the code is compiled to standard JS. so can be used anywhere, fast and secure with less external dependencies.
